# **Do Not Attack Cut and Dried Things**

People are used to seeing data displayed in a usual and logical way. Don't compromise on data visualization standards. But don't attack cut-and-dried things either.
Let’s examine the plot below. At first glance, you can think that gun deaths in Florida have been increasing over time. However, when the Y-axis is checked it can be easily seen that is not quite right. 
It is not your fault. Since people generally think that the vertical axis should increase from bottom to top.

If the data were visualized properly, we would immediately understand that the number of gun deaths in Florida increased rapidly after 2005 and then began to average out.
Here’s another example. The graph below was used by Apple in a presentation in 2008.

Green area belongs to Apple. It may easily thought that the use of a 3D pie chart in this case was intentional (Categories with high percentages, except Apple, are located at the top of the plot). 
Since the green area is made to appear larger than the purple area. However, we all know that 21.2 is bigger than 19.5. When we get rid of the unnecessary third dimension, we can obtain a plot like below.

If the third dimension has no meaningful contribution for your pie charts, please do not use it.

**Conclusion:** Instead of trying to create a cooler visual or misleading readers, it’s better not to attack topics that are cut-and-dried. Making data visualization easy for everyone to understand will make it easier for everyone.
