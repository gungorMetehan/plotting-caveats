**Does Your Plot Look Like Spaghetti?**

"Spaghetti plot” is a term often used to describe multi-category line graphs that contain too many overlapping lines, making them difficult to interpret. When you look at the example below, you’ll immediately understand what I mean.

While the plot above includes valuable information—especially for those working in the field of education sciences—it’s hard to extract meaningful insights at first glance. Sometimes when we want to show all the data points, we may lose sight of the logic of data visualization. Fortunately, there are several ways to clean up these tangled lines and make the message clearer for the reader.

Firstly, we may simply want one category to stand out from the others.

Another option is to display each category (e.g., each country) in its own small multiples or panel plots, allowing for easier comparisons without overwhelming the viewer.

You can also combine these strategies—showing all the data while still highlighting key information.

Different solutions can be found depending on the data and the message to be given. For example, some categories can be combined (e.g. continents) and their averages can be calculated. The average values are then visualized and a single category (one of the countries) can be highlighted.
Interactive plots can be prepared using tools such as Excel, R, Python. These allow users to filter and examine the category they want.
